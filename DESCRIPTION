Description: Sudoku designs (Bailey et al., 2008<doi:10.1080/00029890.2008.11920542>) can be used as experimental designs which tackle one extra source of variation than conventional Latin square designs. Although Sudoku designs are similar to Latin square designs, only addition is the region concept. Some very important functions related to row-column designs as well as block designs along with basic functions are included in this package.
